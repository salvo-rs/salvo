# How to deploy

The Salvo project is an executable file after compilation. When deploying, you only need to upload the executable file and the static resources it depends on to the server.

For Rust projects, there is also a very simple deployment platform: [shuttle.rs](https://www.shuttle.rs). shuttle provides support for Salvo projects, you can move to [official documentation]( https://docs.shuttle.rs/guide/salvo-examples.html).
