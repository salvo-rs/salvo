            The air smelled like freshly cut grass and blooming jasmine as Lila spread a checkered picnic blanket under a tall oak tree. Her 8-year-old nephew, Leo, had already darted off to chase a butterfly, his laughter mixing with the chirp of sparrows and the distant hum of a ice cream truck. She pulled a container of strawberry shortcake from her tote bag—Leo favorite—and smiled when she heard his excited shout: “Aunt Lila! Look what I found!”</p>
            <p>
            He came running back holding a smooth, acorn-shaped rock, his cheeks pink from the sun. “It’s a ‘lucky stone,’” he declared, tucking it into the pocket of his overalls. Lila nodded, pretending to examine it closely. “Definitely lucky. Maybe it’ll help us find the best spot for ice cream later.”</p>

            By late afternoon, the sky had softened into a pale blue, and a gentle breeze carried the scent of someone grilling hamburgers nearby. Leo, now tired from running, curled up on the blanket with his head in Lila’s lap, watching clouds drift by. “Can we do this every weekend?” he mumbled, his eyes heavy. Lila brushed a strand of hair from his forehead. “I think we can manage that.”</p>
            <p>
            As the sun dipped lower, painting the clouds in hues of orange and purple, they packed up their things—Leo clutching his lucky rock, Lila carrying the empty shortcake container. It wasn’t a grand adventure, just a quiet afternoon in the park, but Lila knew these small moments were the ones that would stick with them both.</p>
